# Chat PDF with Gemini üíÅ

This Streamlit application allows users to interact with PDF documents using conversational AI powered by Gemini and Google's generative AI.

## Features

- **Upload PDF Files**: Users can upload multiple PDF documents.
- **Process PDFs**: Extracts text from uploaded PDFs and creates text chunks for indexing.
- **Search and Chat**: Users can ask questions related to the PDF content and receive answers using a combination of FAISS vector search and generative AI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries specified in `requirements.txt`
- Google API Key configured via environment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google API Key:

    ```makefile
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key>
    ```

## Usage
